nenuzhnix
=========

the most useless linux distro

what makes it special
---------------------

 nenuzhnix is one of a kind because of the very specific set of software it is built of/with

 unlike most linux distros nenuzhnix is built of "unpopular" software

 the most special thing about nenuzhnix is it's llvm-based toolchain called ngtc

what it has now
---------------

 - console
 - interactive shell
 - a web browser (thanks, protonesso!)

what it doesn't have at the moment
----------------------------------

 - most of the tools you might need
 - package manager (opkg will be added soon)
 - the kernel (so it's not yet a proper distro)

what it will have in the future
-------------------------------

 - package manager (milestone 0.0.5)
 - linux kernel (milestone 0.1)
 - graphical interface (milestone 1.0) 

what it will never have
-----------------------

 - any of poettering's bloatware in base system (this means no systemd, yay!)
 - xorg or any other xserver (wayland ftw!)
 - scripts written not in posix shell in base system and their interpreters
 - any code from gnu project (this makes this projects a pain)
